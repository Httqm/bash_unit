Really tiny test utility functions

to write tests :
1. source this file
2. call run_test_suite when all your test* functions have been defined

You can write a setup and/or teardown function that will be executed, 
respectively, before and after each test is run.

You can use this functions inside your tests:

* fail
* assert
* assertFail
* assertFailWithStatus
* assertEquals

See sh_test.sh source code for more informations.
